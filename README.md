# CUDA Accelerated Ray Tracer

## Overview
The CUDA Accelerated Ray Tracer is a high-performance graphics rendering engine that leverages CUDA to accelerate the ray tracing process. This project features a variety of primitive shapes including spheres, cylinders, cones, planes, and triangles, making it highly versatile for scene composition.

## Features
- **Basic Illumination Model**: Simple yet powerful lighting with adjustable specular values.
- **Shape Variety**: Spheres, cylinders, cones, planes, and triangles are all supported.
- **Texture Support**: Checkerboard texturing available for all shapes.
- **Color Customization**: Full RGB spectrum support for object and scene coloring.
- **In Progress**: Mirror reflection support for enhanced realism.

## Tech Stack
- C/C++
- CUDA

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CudaAcceleratedRayTracer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd CudaAcceleratedRayTracer
    ```
3. Compile the project:
    ```
    make
    ```
4. Run the executable:
    ```
    ./raytracer
    ```

## Sample Output
_(Consider adding screenshots here to showcase some scenes generated by your ray tracer)_

## Future Plans
- Implement mirror reflection support.
- Add more texture options and material types.
